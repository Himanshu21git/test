Certainly! Here's a Vue 3 test for developers. This test consists of several tasks that will assess a developer's knowledge and skills in working with Vue 3. Candidates will need to write Vue components, use Vue directives, and demonstrate their understanding of Vue concepts. 

### Vue 3 Developer Test

**Task 1: Create a Vue 3 Component**
Create a Vue component called `AppCounter` that displays a button and a counter. When the button is clicked, the counter should increment by 1. Initially, the counter should be set to 0. Use Vue's reactivity system for this task.

**Task 2: Conditional Rendering**
Inside the `AppCounter` component, add a feature that conditionally renders a message below the counter. If the counter is an even number, display the message "Even Number," and if it's an odd number, display "Odd Number."

**Task 3: Vue Directives**
Create a new Vue component called `AppList` that takes an array of items as a prop and displays them in an unordered list (`<ul>`). Use the `v-for` directive to loop through the items and display them as list items (`<li>`). 

**Task 4: Two-Way Binding**
Enhance the `AppList` component to allow users to edit the items directly in the list. Implement two-way binding using the `v-model` directive so that changes made in the input fields update the items in the list and vice versa.

**Task 5: Event Handling**
Create a new Vue component called `AppForm` that contains a form with an input field and a submit button. When the user submits the form, display an alert with the input value. Use the `@submit` event handler to achieve this.

**Task 6: Vuex Integration**
Integrate Vuex into your Vue application. Create a Vuex store with a module called `cart` that stores a list of products. Implement actions to add and remove items from the cart, mutations to update the cart state, and getters to retrieve cart data.

**Task 7: Routing**
Set up Vue Router in your application and create two routes - one for the home page and another for a product detail page. When a user clicks on a product in the cart (from Task 6), they should be navigated to the product detail page, where details of the product are displayed.

**Task 8: Axios API Integration**
Make an HTTP GET request to a JSON API endpoint of your choice (e.g., a mock JSON data API). Fetch data from the API and display it in a component. Use the Axios library for this task.

**Task 9: Component Communication**
Create a parent component called `AppParent` and two child components, `ChildA` and `ChildB`. Pass data from `AppParent` to `ChildA`, and then emit an event from `ChildA` to `AppParent`. Pass this event data from `AppParent` to `ChildB`. Display the received event data in `ChildB`.

**Task 10: Custom Directive**
Create a custom Vue directive called `v-highlight`. This directive should change the background color of an element when it's used in a template. Use this directive in a component to highlight a specific element.

Candidates should complete these tasks in a Vue 3 project, ensuring that the code is clean, well-organized, and follows best practices. They should also include comments to explain their code where necessary.
